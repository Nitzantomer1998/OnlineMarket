# OnlineMarket
OnlineMarket is an application for online shopping such as Ebay, Amazon, Zara, Prada, etc.

Hello everyone and welcome to my project OnlineMarket.
As a student i made this project mainly for self experience
but found out to love the outcome so i kept improving the
Code over a few weeks.

I have built a system that allows you to manage an Online shopping Website/Application.
The program allows you to trace your revenue, add, delete or update item details from the catalog.
The program also contain:
Order purchase System
Responsive feedback system
Delivery management system
Inventory management system
Friendly user program
and many many more

The code itself is written in C language
Works mainly with CSV files
with smart and clean console appearance that highlight
mistake from the user such as errors, invalid inputs, etc
in red subtitles that make sure to inform the correct feedback.
Feel free to use this code and ask for extra features.

Thank you for visit and as usual have fun :).
